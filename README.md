# SalesForce-Refresh-Plugin
 Chrome extension to refresh salesforce dashboards
Created a chrome extension using Javascript to refresh the sales force Iframe at user given intervals. Used chrome storage permissions in order to store interval values. The dom was manipulated in order to grab the refresh button within the Iframe dynamically once the Iframe loads.
