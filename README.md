#Refresh Timer Extension

This is a chrome extension that allows the user to set a refresh timer for the current tab. The user can enable or disable the refresh timer and also set the duration of the timer.
Getting Started

To use this extension, simply install it from the chrome webstore and click on the extension icon to open the settings page. From there, you can enable or disable the refresh timer and set the duration of the timer.
How it works

The extension uses the chrome storage API to store the settings for the refresh timer. The settings include the status of the refresh timer (enabled or disabled) and the duration of the timer. The extension then uses the chrome tabs API to refresh the current tab at the specified interval.
